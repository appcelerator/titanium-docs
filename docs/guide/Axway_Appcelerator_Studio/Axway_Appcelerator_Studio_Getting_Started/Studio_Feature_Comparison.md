## Appcelerator Studio

Appcelerator Studio makes it easy to get started with a mobile project built upon the Titanium SDK to produce professional cross-platform mobile applications. It includes integrated templates, sample applications, and vast amounts of educational material to ensure that you are always building on your skills. It helps you to manage your Titanium projects, including writing, developing and integrating add-on modules, debugging, integrating with [cloud services](http://www.appcelerator.com/cloud), testing, packaging, and deploying. Additionally, Appcelerator Studio helps integrate cloud, automated testing, analytics, and crash reporting services, which can be monitored by the [Appcelerator Dashboard](http://platform.appcelerator.com).

## Aptana Studio

Aptana Studio includes a multitude of web coding features, which aid in the authoring of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Python, and Ruby languages. It supports the latest specifications, such as CSS3 and HTML5, with information about the level of support for each element in the major web browsers, as well as code assist, command completion, and code syntax validation.

It features integrated Ruby and JavaScript debuggers that allow you to set breakpoints, control execution, and inspect variables, which results in a far better understanding of your code in action and quicker bug resolution.

Working seamlessly with the popular Version Control System, [Git](http://git-scm.com/), it facilitates Git-based deployments.

Studio also includes a deployment wizard that provides one of the fastest and easiest ways to publish your applications. It supports all the most widely used protocols, such as FTP, SFTP, FTPS, and Capistrano, and works with Rails and 3rd-party hosting platforms, such as [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com/) and [Engine Yard](http://www.engineyard.com/).
