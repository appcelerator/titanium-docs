# Hyperloop Requirements

## Requirements

Youâ€™ll need to have the following installed on your machine as the recommended requirements to use Hyperloop 5.0.0+:

* Titanium SDK: 9.0.0+

* Titanium CLI: 7.0.0+

You can install [Titanium CLI](https://github.com/tidev/titanium) to get the latest version of all these components.

### Optional Dependencies

These dependencies are used only if you plan to integrate hyperloop with them. You **do not** need Alloy or Cocoapods to use Hyperloop, but may use Hyperloop in an Alloy app - or consume 3rd-party libraries on iOS using Cocoapods.

* Alloy 1.8.0+

* [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) 1.0.0+ (see note)

Note: If you plan on using CocoaPods as a third-party dependencies manager, you will need to have (at a minimum) CocoaPods 1.0.0 or later installed. See [Using third-party libraries with CocoaPods](/guide/Titanium_SDK/Titanium_SDK_Guide/Hyperloop/Hyperloop_Guides/iOS_Hyperloop_Programming_Guide/#cocoapods) for details on how to install and set up your project.

## Installation

### Titanium SDK

Titanium SDK can be installed with `ti sdk install latest`.

### Titanium CLI

Refer to [Setting up the Titanium CLI](/guide/Titanium_SDK/Titanium_SDK_Guide/Titanium_Command-Line_Interface_Reference/Appcelerator_CLI_Getting_Started/) for instructions and preparation for installing Titanium CLI.

### Alloy Framework

The Alloy command-line interface and plugin will be automatically installed by the Titanium CLI.
