# Global.Console

<TypeHeader/>

## Overview

The toplevel `console` support is intended to supplement <Titanium.API>
and make it easier for developers to port existing javascript code
(especially CommonJS modules) to Titanium.

Note that `console` does not currently implement the complete
[Console](https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/API/Console) specification.
