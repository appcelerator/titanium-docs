# Modules.URLSession.SessionConfiguration

<TypeHeader/>

## Overview

These APIs are supported on iOS 7 and later.

An NSURLSessionConfiguration object defines the behavior and policies to use
when uploading and downloading data using an URLSession object. When uploading
or downloading data, creating a configuration object is always the first step
you must take. You use this object to configure the timeout values, caching
policies, connection requirements, and other types of information that you
intend to use with your URLSession object.
