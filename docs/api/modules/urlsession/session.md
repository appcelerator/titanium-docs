## Overview

These APIs are supported on iOS 7 and later.

The NSURLSession class and related classes provide an API for downloading content. 
This API provides a rich set of delegate methods for supporting authentication and gives 
your app the ability to perform background downloads when your app is not running or, in iOS, 
while your app is suspended.
