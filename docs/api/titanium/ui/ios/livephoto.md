# Titanium.UI.iOS.LivePhoto

<TypeHeader/>

## Overview

Use the <Titanium.UI.iOS.createLivePhotoView> to assign the `livePhoto` property. 
You can receive a LivePhoto by using the [openPhotoGallery](Titanium.Media.openPhotoGallery) method.
iOS 9.1 only allows to select existing photos from the gallery, capturing new live photos is not 
supported by the iOS public API, yet.

Note: This object only represents the proxy to hold a live photo and can not be created manually.
