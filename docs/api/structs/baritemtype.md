# BarItemType

<TypeHeader/>

## Overview

A button bar or tabbed bar item can have an image or a title, but not both. 
Buttons with images and buttons with text can be mixed in the same bar, however. 

If both `image` and `title` properties are specified for a given item, the `image` property 
takes precedence and the `title` property is ignored.
