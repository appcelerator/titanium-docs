# ListDataItem

<ProxySummary/>

## Overview

In addition to the properties defined below, you can define custom key-value pairs, which bind to
the child templates of an <ItemTemplate>.  The key for these pairs match the `bindId` of
the child view templates and the values are a dictionary of view properties applied to the view components.
Any other properties that are not identified by a `bindId` are permitted but are ignored by the item template.

See <Titanium.UI.ListItem> for examples of using a list data item.
