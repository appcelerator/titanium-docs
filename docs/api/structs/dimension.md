# Dimension

<TypeHeader/>

## Overview

When a dimension is returned by the [rect](Titanium.UI.View.rect) property, `x` represents the
view's left position, and `y` represents the view's top position.

The [size](Titanium.UI.View.size) property returns a dimension object with `x` and `y` both set
to 0.
